# create virtual enviroment, I used conda from Anaconda. You can use python's venv if you want
conda create -n objects python=3.6
conda activate objects

# install needed libraries
pip install tensorflow==1.14.0
or 
pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.14.0  # careful with cuda version here it should be 10, to check cuda version: nvcc --version
# if you have cuda version 9, try installing tensorflow-gpu==1.12.0
# if you face problems later, it might be due to GPU compatiblity with software and the library. Try to use tensorflow without GPU support

pip install keras==2.1.5
pip install Pillow matplotlib opencv-python

# get the code for YOLO, built with Keras library
git clone https://github.com/qqwweee/keras-yolo3.git

cd keras-yolo3

# download YOLOv3 weights from YOLO website:
wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights

#convert the Darknet YOLO model to a Keras model, run the following command
python convert.py yolov3.cfg yolov3.weights model_data/yolo.h5

# you sould now be able to use YOLO as follows:
# detection on Images, runt the following command, then enter the image path
python yolo_video.py --image

# detection on Videos, run the following command
python yolo_video.py [video_path] [output_path (optional)]
python yolo_video.py --input 0


Note: if you face the following error: "AttributeError: 'str' objects has no attribute 'decode'"
it might be due incompatibility with h5py libarary. Solve this, uninstall it then install a version compatable with the other libraries:
pip uninstall h5py
pip install h5py==2.10.0
